### Why DWM?

Keeping things simple, minimal and usable.

**dwm** is customized through editing its source code, which makes it extremely
fast and secure - it does not process any input data which isn't known at
compile time. To customize it for your needs, you need to know C.

**Because dwm is customized through editing its source code, it's pointless to
make binary packages of it. This keeps its userbase small and elitist. No
novices asking stupid questions.**
